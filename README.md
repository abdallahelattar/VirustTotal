# VirustTotal
A GUI dealing with VirusTotal API to offer easy scan for urls or files for windows users.
Note that I used my API key in "execute" class to use VirusTotal API as it requires a key to use it, you can change it to yours if you wish to use it freely as the maximum requests is 4 requests per minute per API key, so if anyone else is using the key at the same time you do, you will get less amount of requests per minute.
